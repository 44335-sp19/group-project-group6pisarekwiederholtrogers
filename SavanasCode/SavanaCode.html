      <h1>Savana Wiederholt</h1>
      <p class="lead">IDM: Computer Science</p>
      <p> I am currently a Senior at Northwest Missouri State University in Maryville, Missouri studying Digital Media with an emphasis in New Media. This major has allowed me to gain experience in a variety of areas including graphic design in print and digital, web development and web design, and advertising and marketing strategies. I am also involved in the Advertising Club on campus which has given me opportunities to tour advertising agencies and network with professionals in the field. I graduate in December of 2019, and plan to seek a career at an advertising agency in Kansas City as a designer. I am very organized and detail oriented, and I love to learn new things. I also love adventure and traveling.</p>

            <figcaption class="text-center"><b>Tracking Macros Infographic</b> <br> <br>This infographic is intended to inform viewers about the advantages of tracking macros and calories to meet personal goals and how to figure out how many calories one should be intaking based on Basal Metabolic Rate and activity level. After determining how many calories one should intake per day, the infographic walks through how to break calories down into macronutrients including carbs, proteins, and fats. </figcaption>

            <figcaption class="text-center"> <b>Cedar Ridge Rustic Millwork Website</b> <br> <br>This website is for a timber, iron and millwork company that focuses on timber frame trusses and rustic renovations. This company rebranded from a 30 year old custom home building company so I created a new website to showcase his new products and services and appeal to his target market. The website also accompanied a complete rebranding of his business. I designed the website using a CMS, Wix for usability and ease of editing. Here is the link to the website: <a href="https://www.cedarridgerusticmillwork.com.">Cedar Ridge Rustic Millwork</a> </figcaption>
